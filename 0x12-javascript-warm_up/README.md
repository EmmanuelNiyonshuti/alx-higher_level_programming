		0x12. JavaScript - Warm up

[![js-semistandard-style](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/standard/semistandard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/standard/semistandard)

	This project provided a comprehensive introduction to JavaScript fundamentals.
	By completing the tasks, I acquired  essential knowledge on why JavaScript is remarkable,
	how to execute JavaScript scripts, manage variables and constants, understand data types,
	utilize conditional statements and loops, work with functions, and handle scope and arithmetic operations.
	The tasks cover a range of concepts, from basic script printing to more advanced topics like
	recursion and function manipulation. Ensure compliance with project requirements,
	following code standards, and maintaining executable files
