# 0x14. JavaScript - Web Scraping

In this project, I worked on using the `fs` module in Node.js to perform various file operations such as reading and writing files. Additionally, I learned to interact with different APIs, including:

1. **Star Wars API**: [https://swapi-api.alx-tools.com/api/films/](https://swapi-api.alx-tools.com/api/films/)
2. **JSONPlaceholder**: [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos) - a free, fake, and reliable API for testing and prototyping

Throughout the project, I utilized the `request` module to make HTTP requests to these APIs and handle their responses.

## Topics Covered

- Performing file operations with the `fs` module
  - Reading files
  - Writing files
- Making HTTP requests using the `request` module
- Parsing and manipulating JSON data
- Interacting with external APIs

## API Interactions

### Star Wars API

The Star Wars API provides information about the films in the Star Wars universe. I learned to fetch details about the films and extract specific data, such as film titles and character information.

### JSONPlaceholder

JSONPlaceholder is a free online REST API that I used for testing and prototyping. It provides various endpoints, including a `todos` endpoint which returns a list of to-do items. I practiced fetching and processing this data in my scripts.

## Usage

To run the scripts in this project, you need to have Node.js installed. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd repository-name

3. Install the required dependencies:
   npm install

4. Run the scripts:
   node script-name.js
