This project focuses on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. It covers the essentials such as classes, objects, and instances, attributes (public, protected, private), methods, and special methods like __init__. The journey extends to understanding Data Abstraction, Encapsulation, and Information Hiding, along with properties, getters, setters, and dynamic attribute creation.
