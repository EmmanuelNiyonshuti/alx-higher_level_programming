				0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

	This project explores fundamental concepts in JavaScript programming, focusing on objects, scopes, and closures.
	Through a series of tasks, I delved into creating and manipulating objects, understanding variable scopes,
	and mastering the concept of closures.
	The tasks also cover inheritance, prototypes, and practical applications of these concepts in JavaScript programming.
