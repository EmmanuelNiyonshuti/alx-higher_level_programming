This directory focus on Test Driven Development in Python.
in this direstory I studied Test Driven Development and practised the concept on tasks including adding integers, dividing matrices, printing names and shapes, and implementing matrix multiplication. Additionally, there's a task for writing unittests and another for printing Python strings using.
This helped me understand how Test Driven Development works and how to Do it.
