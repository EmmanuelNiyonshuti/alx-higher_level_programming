This directory continues with Object Oriented Programming in Python.
In this project i learned and practiced on tasks including:
Simple Rectangle: Define an empty Rectangle class.

Real definition of a rectangle: Rectangle class with width and height attributes, handling invalid inputs.

Area and Perimeter: Calculate area and perimeter of the rectangle.

String representation: Represent the rectangle as a string, handle zero dimensions.

Eval is magic: Enable instance recreation with eval().

Detect instance deletion: Print message on instance deletion.

How many instances: Track instance creation and deletion.

Change representation: Customize string symbol.

Compare rectangles: Compare rectangles by area.

A square is a rectangle: Create a square instance with equal width and height.

It continued strengthening and solidifying my understanding of OOP in python.
