                # 0x15. JavaScript - Web jQuery
* This project focuses on using JavaScript and jQuery to manipulate the DOM, handle user events, and fetch data dynamically. By completing the tasks, I learned how to select and modify HTML elements, handle events, and use jQuery Ajax for making GET and POST requests. The tasks range from basic DOM manipulation to fetching data from APIs and updating the web page dynamically.

                ## Key Concepts and Tasks
* DOM Manipulation: learned to change styles, add classes, and update content using jQuery.
* Event Handling: Bind and handle user events like clicks to trigger JavaScript functions.
* AJAX Requests: Fetch and display data from external APIs using jQuery Ajax.
* Tasks: Tasks include updating text color, toggling classes, adding list items, and fetching data from  APIs like [Star Wars API](https://swapi-api.alx-tools.com/api/people/5/?format=json) and a [Hello translation API](https://hellosalut.stefanbohacek.dev/?lang=fr).
Each task reinforces the concepts and practical applications of jQuery in web development.
